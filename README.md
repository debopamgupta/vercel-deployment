Things deployed :-

- Static site using HTML, CSS, JS only.
- ReactJS site ( Boilerplate only ).
- Serverless Functions ( example from the vercel docs website plus some other stuff)
  - NodeJS site - static directory serving is only thing which is available. other express stuff cannot be done. Use Serverless Functions for that.
